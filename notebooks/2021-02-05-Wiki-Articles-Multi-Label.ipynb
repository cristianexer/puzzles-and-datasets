    "The growing availability of information in the past decade has allowed internet users to find vast amounts of information online, but this has come with more and more deceptive articles designed to advertise or promote a product or ideology. In addition, hidden sponsored news articles have grown in prevalence in recent years as news organizations have shifted their business strategy to account for developments in technology and content consumption. It is for this reason that having a system in place to detect these deceptive practices is more important than ever.\n",
